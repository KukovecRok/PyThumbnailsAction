# thumbnails-readme-action


Repository for [thumbnails-readme](https://github.com/firefly-cpp/thumbnails-readme) PyPI package action.

This action generates thumbnails for images in your repository and adds them to README.md file.

## How to use

You may use this action in your workflow to generate thumbnails for images in your repository and add them to README.md file.
There are two ways to use this action:
* create artifacts (may upload manually)
* github-actions[bot] directly commits to your repository

### Create a workflow

```yml
name: Create thumbnails
on: [push]
jobs:
  build:
    if: github.event.head_commit.message != 'Update README.md and image_thumbnails'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          ref: ${{ github.head_ref }}
      - name: generate_thumbnails
        uses: KukovecRok/thumbnails-readme-action@v1.4
```

### Create artifact

```yml
      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: my-generated-thumbnails
          path: |
            README.md
            image_thumbnails/**
```

### Create Pull-Request

```yml
      - run: sudo chown -R $USER:$USER .
      - name: Create Pull Request
        uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v4.2.3
        with:
          commit-message: create-pull-request Update README.md and image_thumbnails
          add-paths: |
            README.md
            image_thumbnails/**
          base: ${{ github.head_ref }}
          title: Update README.md and image_thumbnails
          body: Automatically generated image thumbnails and pull-request
```
#### Imporant with Pull-Request

To prevent PR loop, you can, for example, add an if statement. This provided example checks, if latest commit message includes "create-pull-request". If it does, it skips the workflow action, since image thumbnails have already been generated. 

```yml
if: "!contains(github.event.head_commit.message, 'create-pull-request')"
```

### Auto-commit

```yml
      - uses: stefanzweifel/git-auto-commit-action@v4
        with:
          add_options: '-A'
          file_pattern: 'README.md image_thumbnails/*.png'
          commit_message: "Update README.md and image_thumbnails"
```
